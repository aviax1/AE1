Science can be summed up in 2 principles: Accuracy (Empiricism) and efficiency/entropy (Occam's razor).
It is known in the mathematical community that there is a computational equivalence between them, or between compression and prediction.

auto-encoder or nerual network with a bottleneck Can be train to compress certain information such as similar images .
i use mnist database and 10 autoencoder's (each one for each digit train data ) to show that method can get good result 98.53% -99.714%  accuracy (kaggle-github databases) .

based on Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem signal to noise ratio (SNR) increase in the  bottleneck ,
Therefore autoencodes will be more efficiention tool when the SNR is low(high noise).
