Science can be summed up in 2 principles: Accuracy (Empiricism) and efficiency/entropy (Occam's razor).
It is known in the mathematical community that there is a computational equivalence between them, or between compression and prediction.

auto-encoder or nerual network with a bottleneck Can be train to compress certain information such as similar images .
i use mnist database and 10 autoencoder's (each one for each digit train data ) to show that method can get good result  98.53% -99.714%  accuracy (kaggle-github databases) .
signal to noise ratio (SNR) in some cases decreases when the bottleneck decreases,Therefore autoencoders can allow more efficient classification of tasks with big SNR.
